# GitHub Actions Overview

GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD and automation platform integrated into GitHub. It allows you to automate workflows for building, testing, and deploying your code directly from your repository.

## Key Features

- **Automation:** Automate software workflows like CI/CD, testing, and deployments.
- **Custom Workflows:** Define workflows using YAML files in `.github/workflows/`.
- **Marketplace:** Use and share actions from the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions).
- **Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with GitHub events (push, pull request, etc.).

## Example Workflow

Below is a simple workflow that runs tests on every push:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v4
            - name: Set up Node.js
                uses: actions/setup-node@v4
                with:
                    node-version: '18'
            - run: npm install
            - run: npm test
```

## Getting Started

1. Create a `.github/workflows/` directory in your repository.
2. Add a YAML file (e.g., `ci.yml`) with your workflow definition.
3. Commit and push your changesâ€”GitHub Actions will run automatically!
